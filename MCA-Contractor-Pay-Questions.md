# Contractor Pay - Questions for Amara

Hey Amara, we're building the contractor pay into the app so it calculates everything automatically. We pulled what we could from the spreadsheet screenshots but we're missing some pieces. A few questions:

We only have data for Musical Expressions right now. For that one, we have the base contractor pay at $38.50 for 30 min and what looks like $54.00 for 45 min (Megan's $0.50 increase gives $54.50 which matches). Can you confirm those base amounts? Here's what we calculate for everyone on Musical Expressions - do these match your spreadsheet?

| Contractor | Increase | 30 min | 45 min |
|------------|----------|--------|--------|
| Colleen    | +$2.00   | $41.50 (custom $39.50 + $2) | $56.00 |
| Caroline   | +$2.00   | $40.50 | $56.00 |
| Megan      | +$0.50   | $39.00 | $54.50 |
| Jacob      | +$1.50   | $40.00 | $55.50 |
| Katie      | +$2.00   | $40.50 | $56.00 |
| Miley      | +$1.50   | $40.00 | $55.50 |

Can you explain in a few sentences how you determine the contractor base pay for a given service type and duration? For example, how did you arrive at $38.50 for Musical Expressions at 30 min and $54.00 at 45 min - is there a formula or rule you follow, or are those just manually decided amounts? Understanding the logic would help us set up the other service types correctly without needing every number individually.

We're also missing the contractor pay amounts for the other service types - In-Home Individual, In-Home Group, Matt's Music Individual, Matt's Music Group, Individual Art, Group Art, Admin, and anything else you use. If you can share a screenshot of those columns from your spreadsheet or just the base pay at 30 and 45 min for each, that would be great.

On the increase/bonus amounts (+$2 for Colleen, +$0.50 for Megan, etc.) - does that stay the same flat amount regardless of session length? For example, Colleen always gets +$2 whether it's 30 min or 90 min? That's how we have it set up now.

A few more things: Are Brianna Nilsen and Madeline Gilbert still active? If so, what are their increase amounts? Is Colleen the only one with a custom base rate ($39.50 for Musical Expressions vs the $38.50 default), or do any other contractors have special rates? And are there any service types we're missing that aren't in the list above?
