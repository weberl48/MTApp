# Contractor Pay - Questions for Amara

Hey Amara, we're setting up contractor pay in the app and have a few things to confirm. Right now we only have data from the Musical Expressions columns in your spreadsheet, so we need the same info for the other service types too.

For Musical Expressions, we have the base contractor pay at $38.50 for 30 min. The 45-min base looks like it might be $54.00 rather than $53.00 - when we add Megan's $0.50 increase to $54.00 we get $54.50, which matches the spreadsheet. Can you confirm the 45-min base is $54.00? And can you check that these calculated amounts match what you see for everyone?

| Contractor | Increase | 30 min | 45 min |
|------------|----------|--------|--------|
| Colleen    | +$2.00   | $41.50 (custom $39.50 + $2) | $56.00 |
| Caroline   | +$2.00   | $40.50 | $56.00 |
| Megan      | +$0.50   | $39.00 | $54.50 |
| Jacob      | +$1.50   | $40.00 | $55.50 |
| Katie      | +$2.00   | $40.50 | $56.00 |
| Miley      | +$1.50   | $40.00 | $55.50 |

We also need the base contractor pay at each duration for the other service types (In-Home Individual, In-Home Group, Matt's Music Individual, Matt's Music Group, Individual Art, Group Art, Admin, and any others you use). A screenshot of those columns from your spreadsheet would be perfect.

On the increase/bonus - does the amount stay the same flat dollar amount regardless of session length? For example, Colleen always gets +$2 whether it's 30 min or 90 min? That's how the app handles it right now, just want to make sure that's correct.

Lastly, do Brianna and Madeline have increase amounts too, and are they still active? And is Colleen the only contractor with a custom base rate ($39.50 for Musical Expressions), or do any others have special rates for specific service types?
