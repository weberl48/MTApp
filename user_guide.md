## View As Feature

You can see exactly what your contractors see by using the **View As** feature:

1. Look for the **View As** dropdown in the header
2. Select a contractor to view the app as them
3. The sidebar and data will filter to show only their view
4. Click **Exit View** (select "Owner (actual)") to return to your normal view

This is helpful for understanding the contractor experience or troubleshooting issues.

### Previewing the Client Portal

To see what a specific client sees in their portal:

1. Go to **Clients** > click on a client
2. Look for the **Portal Access** section
3. If they have a portal link, click **View Portal** to open it in a new tab
4. If they don't have one yet, click **Generate Link** to create one

The client portal shows them:
- Their upcoming and past sessions
- Their invoices and payment status
- Resources you've shared (homework, files, links)

## Invoice Workflow

1. **Contractor logs session** with client(s) and submits
2. **You approve the session** (or it auto-approves based on settings)
3. **Invoice is generated** for each client in the session
4. **You send the invoice** via email or Square
5. **Client pays** (Square updates automatically, or you mark as paid manually)
6. **Contractor sees their pay** in the Payments section

---

## Client Portal

Each client can have a secure portal link where they can:
- View their upcoming and past sessions
- See their invoices
- Access resources you share with them (homework, files, links)

To set up a client's portal:
1. Go to **Clients** > click a client
2. Look for **Portal Access** section
3. Generate a portal link to share with them
